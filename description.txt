0. [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/509590093865943751] Waiting for the official implementation of this mod function Development Log #182 《 Terra Obscura 》[/url]
1. make a version with just the congenital traits hidden.
2. add the possiblity of being able to see the portrait of those who died and you already knew what they looked like.


[h3]"bugs" will not be fixed:[/h3]
1. "Seems there is a graphical bug w/e entering the culture view, the culture head portrait/placeholder flashes constantly; I'm getting flickering. Unknown character portraits flicker with a white box when moving the mouse. " [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/gui-and-hud-flickering.1867948] It looks like a paradox bug. [/url] I also encountered it, I guess it is related to the system configuration (VRAM/GPU/RAM/CPU) & driver (DX11/Vulkan).
2. "When I choose a task for the Kurultai (tribal council), the UI reveals the exact value of the relevant stat" - Sadly, this info cannot be hidden by modding, I tried. It is encapsulated by Paradox into a whole. The original Obfus mod has not modified this either; however, the non-nomadic text of the vanilla game does not contain stat values. the code is hard-coded into the following: COUNCIL_TASK_EFFECTS: "#S Effets#!\n[ActiveCouncilTask.GetTaskEffect]"

3. Not-mentioned-above mod compatibility issues ("AGOT", "EK2", "Better Battle View", "More Family Relations", "Height of Crown", "Fallen Eagle", "CoA mod(Patrum Scuta, Happy Heraldry, etc.)", etc. )
[h2]3.1Compatibility:[/h2][b][i][u]Just like the original Obfusckate mod. Since this is a UI overhaul mod, you can try to put it at the bottom of the list as much as possible to cover the modifications of other mods.  Adding this mod in the mid-campaign is OK, but removing it may cause a "crash to desktop", since there are too many "delay = { " of "pulse " in "on_action" files. [/u][/i][/b]

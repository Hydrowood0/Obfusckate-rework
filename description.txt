- This mod has made massive fixes based on the original Obfus mod and tries to catch up with vanilla updates. 1.16&1.18-related functions are still under development. If you encounter any bugs when using only the following mods in the order list, please don't hesitate to tell me immediately.
- [b][u]Unsubscribe and resubscribe[/u][/b] to this mod to prevent lagging and invalidation ([u][b]to avoid some bugs in old versions of this mod[/b][/u]) after my update. (Many modders report that there is an issue with [i][u]Steam sometimes redistributing old version of the mod [/u][/i]. I've contacted Steam, but they won't do anything to fix this issue.)

[h3]todo：[/h3]
0. [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/509590093865943751] Waiting for the official implementation of this mod function Development Log #182 《 Terra Obscura 》[/url]
1. "befriend_scheme.txt" "convert_to_witchcraft_scheme" "sway_scheme.txt" These three files are too difficult to compare and update. I will use the original vanilla ones for the time being.


[h3]"bugs" will not be fixed:[/h3]
1. "Seems there is a graphical bug w/e entering the culture view, the culture head portrait/placeholder flashes constantly; I'm getting flickering. Unknown character portraits flicker with a white box when moving the mouse. " [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/gui-and-hud-flickering.1867948] It looks like a paradox bug. [/url] I also encountered it, I guess it is related to the system configuration (VRAM/GPU/RAM/CPU) & driver (DX11/Vulkan).
2. Not-mentioned-above mod compatibility issues ("Better Battle View", "More Family Relations", "Height of Crown", "Fallen Eagle", "CoA mod(Patrum Scuta, Happy Heraldry, etc.)", etc. )
3. "When I choose a task for the Kurultai (tribal council), the UI reveals the exact value of the relevant stat" - Sadly, this info cannot be hidden by modding, I tried. It is encapsulated by Paradox into a whole. The original Obfus mod has not modified this either; however, the non-nomadic text of the vanilla game does not contain stat values. the code is hard-coded into the following: COUNCIL_TASK_EFFECTS: "#S Effets#!\n[ActiveCouncilTask.GetTaskEffect]"
